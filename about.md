Hi, I'm Gergely TÃ³th (pronounced as gergej tot) or just simply Greg. I work as a
Software Developer at [MPC](http://moving-picture.com) working on web based
tools.

Born with computers and been programming since I can remember. Currently
my main focus is on JavaScript, that all trendy React and NodeJS.

Fascinated by terminals, tmux, and vim.
