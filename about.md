Hi, I'm Gergely TÃ³th (pronounced as gergej tot) or just simply Greg. I work as a
Digital Developer at [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/) working on
sponsored content & internal tools.

Born with computers and been programming since I can remember. Currently
my main focus is on JavaScript, that all trendy React and NodeJS.

Fascinated by terminals, tmux, and vim.
