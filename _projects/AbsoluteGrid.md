Absolute Grid is a grid system what positions all grid elements absolutely to
enable transitioning any of its elements without shifting or moving the rest of
the layout.

Wrote this code because every grid when I wanted to make a larger card based
grid layout, and when clicking that card, opening it in a way, that all the
content of the card should remain, plus some of the hidden items to display.
There was options that, I could duplicate the content into a modal, but I felt
that was a cheap solution, but when wanting to move, enlarge the gird item,
the rest of the items moved with it.

With Absolute Grid, all items are calculated and absolutely positioned, so you
can do anything with any of the items, and will remain in the same position.
